            <h3>School Introduction:</h3>
            <hr />
            <p>The Ottawa Catholic School Board Korean School was established in 1977 through the efforts of Korean immigrants. Over the years, with the dedication of many Korean school teachers, the school has grown its student body. Starting in 1991, the Ontario provincial government began providing funding based on the number of students to ensure a proper educational environment. As part of the International Language Program (ILP), Korean Credit Program was established to offer high school credits.</p>
            <br />
            <p>Since its establishment, the Ottawa Catholic School Board Korean School has been providing opportunities for Korean-Canadian children to learn the Korean language, culture, and history. It has contributed significantly to maintaining and developing the mother tongue of Korean immigrants, fostering Korean pride and identity.</p>
            <br />
            <p>Furthermore, it aims to foster global talents who can naturally understand and embrace both Korean and Canadian cultures, enabling them to demonstrate their abilities in any society in the future.</p>
